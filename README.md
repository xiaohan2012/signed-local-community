# searching for local polarization


# Usage

## run query on graphs

- run a batch of queries on graph: `run_queries_in_batch.py`
- print commands that each runs a batch of queries (for parallel computing): `print_batch_query_commands.py`


## experiment on synthetic graphs

- effect of noise parameter: `run_experiment_effect_of_eta.py`
- effect of correlation parameter: `run_experiment_effect_of_kappa.py`
- effect of number of outlier nods: `run_experiment_effect_of_outlier_size.py`
- effect of number of seed: `run_experiment_effect_of_seed_size.py`
